# Development Dot Files

These are dotfiles to configure Bash for development when working with OS X. The `.aliases` and `.exports` files are taken and stripped down versions of [Mathias Bynens's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

# To Do

Replace `install.sh` with a more robust Ansible script.
