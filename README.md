# Dot Files
These are my dotfiles to for development on Mac OS X. The `.aliases` and `.exports` files are taken and stripped down versions of [Mathias Bynens's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

## To Dos
* Replace `install.sh` with a more robust Ansible script.
* Implement parts of [Sensible Bash](http://mrzool.cc/writing/sensible-bash/).
* Look into using Homebrew Cask to install apps (see [Developing on Yosemite](http://fredkelly.net/articles/2014/10/19/developing_on_yosemite.html)).
* Move bash profile into sub directory and use Stow to link up.
