# Development Dot Files

These are dotfiles to configure Bash for development when working with OS X. The `.aliases` and `.exports` files are taken and stripped down versions of [Mathias Bynens's Dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles).

# Todo

* Replace `install.sh` with a more robust Ansible script.
* Look into using Homebrew Cask to install apps (see [Developing on Yosemite](http://fredkelly.net/articles/2014/10/19/developing_on_yosemite.html)) .
* Switch to ZSH shell. Will require shell scripts to be updated.
